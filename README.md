# Medical_Store_Management_System
A medical store management system in a database management project is a software application that helps medical shops manage their inventory, sales, and customer records.
It enables the recording and management of all activities of the medical shop, including stock management, billing, and reporting.
The system can automate tasks such as stock tracking, sales reporting, and provide real-time inventory data, allowing for better stock management and ordering decisions.
